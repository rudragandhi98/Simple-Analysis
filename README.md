For Hw7-1: Utilized an admission dataset from Kaggle. Created a scatter plot and labeled the dependent and independent variables. Then calculated the slope, and the least squares line to display the linear 
regression line. Also, calculated the coefficient of determination and correlation coefficent. We tried to construct the regression line for two different 
parameters and see which one had a stronger corelation co-efficient(r) Gre Score and Chance of Admit had a r of 0.7 while the r for CGPA and Chance of Admit 
was 0.8. So we came to the conclusion that even though the value of r indicates a strong relationship between CGPA and Chance of Admit,there is an involvement 
of third elements like Toefl Score and GRE which are the reason why there is such a strong relationship between two. We used two different regressions here 
to show how the regression varies depending on the differnet dependednt variables. Here Chance of Admit wasnt solely due to the CGPA but due to GRE ,
Toefl scores as well as CGPA.

For Hw7-2: Utilized an advertising dataset from Kaggle. We showed 3 scatter plots showing how Sales is dependent on TV, Radio, and Newspaper. 
Also, showed the regression line for the TV and sales. The correlation coefficient accurately reflects the strength of the relationship for TV and 
Sales as strong, by looking at the regression line and the correlation coefficient this shows that this is a very strong realtionship. 
The correlation coefficent came out to .901, so this would be considered a very strong linear relationship. The values of Sales (y) are caused by the values
of TV (x). For this scenario there is no third party involvement,the sales due to TV are not influenced by sales due to Radio or Newspapers.Hence it is a 
direct relationship uninfluenced by any third part element here.(we showed scatter plots to demonstrate how the sales are scattered for different 
mediums(TV,Radio and Newspaper).If we observe,we can see that TV had the most plots in a linear way but for the Radio and Newspaper are scattered 
around the graph.
